Live Demo => https://banegerous.github.io/Speak-a-color/

Like the text to speech app, this is an exploration into speaking to make the DOM change an element. In this case it's color. 
There are a limited number of colors you can choose from, here is the list: 
        'red',
        'blue',
        'green',
        'yellow',
        'pink',
        'brown',
        'purple',
        'orange',
        'black',
        'white',
